Heart disease, primarily coronary artery disease (CAD), is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. CAD occurs when the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle, become narrowed or blocked due to the buildup of fatty deposits, or plaques. These plaques are composed of cholesterol, cellular waste products, calcium, and fibrin, leading to a condition known as atherosclerosis. When these arteries become restricted, the heart receives insufficient oxygen and nutrients, causing chest pain (angina) or, in severe cases, triggering a heart attack. Risk factors for developing CAD include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and a sedentary lifestyle. Prevention and management of heart disease often involve lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, and medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and diabetes.

Furthermore, recent advancements in medical research have shed light on the genetic components of heart disease, revealing that certain gene mutations can predispose individuals to CAD. These genetic markers are being explored for their potential in personalized medicine, where treatments and preventative strategies are tailored to an individual's genetic profile. Innovations in diagnostic techniques, such as cardiac imaging and blood tests for biomarkers, have significantly improved early detection and management of heart disease. Additionally, interventional cardiology has evolved with minimally invasive procedures like angioplasty and the use of stents to open blocked arteries, as well as advanced surgical techniques like coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to restore proper blood flow to the heart. Despite these advancements, continuous research and public health efforts are essential to combat the prevalence and impact of heart disease globally.
